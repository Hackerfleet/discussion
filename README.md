Hackerfleet - Discussion
========================

The Hackerfleet "exclusive" discussion board :-)

The general idea is to discuss the pathway and general direction for future
maritime technologies.  Feel free to express even wild ideas, our aim is to be
as open as possible.

Nutcase technology will sort itself out anyway ,)

Exclusive?! Yes, you'll have to sign up with github and become part of the
Hackerfleet organization by requesting to join, if you want to actively
participate in the discussion. Nothing else involved. No payments, no
restrictions, nothing - all free!

Howto
=====

Please [head over to the forum](https://github.com/hackerfleet/discuss/issues/) after reading:

* Always be polite, obey the netiquette, please
* Discourse should be related to these topics:
 * (opensource) maritime technology
 * project ideas
 * community events & potential hackathons
* Check before reposting!
* For hfos feature requests, use it's issue tracker

If you want to post, request forum participation by pinging
@ri0t or @ij0n, you'll be invited to the github organization.

Since we use github's issue tracker as "forum" replacement,
some things should be considered:
* Use the tags and filter, luke!
* Don't close issues, please.
* No code in the repository itself. Commits and other requests
  will largely be ignored.

Have fun collaborrrrating!
